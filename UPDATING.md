When a new version of this program is released, you should rebuild
your CTSS environment as incremental upgrades are not supported.

1. Have you added or edited any files inside CTSS? If so ensure you
   have downloaded them to your host machine. If you have just
   compiled and run ELIZA, nothing to do here.
2. Delete your old CTSS environment by running `rm -r dasd/`
3. Follow the steps in the quickstart in [`README.md`](README.md) from
   the beginning. (Some steps may have changed from when you did it
   last time).
